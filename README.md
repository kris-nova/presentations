# Lorenzo Fontana's TERM Presentations

- [Falco Internals 101](/falco-internals-101): What happens when you have: syscalls, a kernel module, an eBPF probe and a Ring Buffer?

## How to make this work?

Usually I put a PDF link in the readme of each presentation, if you can't find it you can run them on YOUR terminal in this way:

1. First download zomg.

```bash
go get github.com/kris-nova/public-speaking/zomg
```

2. Then run the presentation you want, e.g:

```bash
zomg -t hack falco-internals-101
```

## Where's everything?
You can find all my other (non given from a terminal) presentations [on my website](https://fntlnz.wtf/downloads/).
